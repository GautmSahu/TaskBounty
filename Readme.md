## Overview
This project provides a RESTful API and GUI for managing apps and user points using Django and Django REST Framework. It includes authentication, app management (CRUD), and user points tracking for completed tasks.

---

## üìå Features
- **Authentication using Django Allauth (Token-based)**
- **Admin Panel for managing apps**
- **User Panel for tracking points & submitting task proofs**
- **API Endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting apps**
- **Task submission with screenshot upload (drag and drop support)**

---

##  ‚úÖ Technologies Used
-  **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework (DRF), Django-Allauth
-  **Database**: PostgreSQL (or SQLite for local dev)
-  **Authentication**: Django-Allauth (Session-based authentication)
-  **Frontend**: Jinja2, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for UI)
-  **Security**: Custom permissions to restrict access

---

## üîí Permissions:

- **Admin**: Can create, update, delete apps but cannot access user points.
- **User**: Can view apps, submit screenshots for points, but cannot modify apps.
- If a user tries to perform an unauthorized action, they will receive
  ```json
  {
    "detail": "You do not have permission to perform this action."
  }
  ```

## Questions asked
1. Write and share a small note about your choice of system to schedule periodic tasks (such as downloading a list of ISINs every 24 hours). Why did you choose it? Is it reliable enough; Or will it scale? If not, what are the problems with it? And, what else would you recommend to fix this problem at scale in production?
  - Ans: For scheduling periodic tasks in Django, Celery with Redis as a message broker is a popular and reliable choice.

     - Why Celery?
     - Asynchronous & Distributed ‚Äì Celery is designed for handling background tasks asynchronously, allowing Django to remain responsive.
     - Scalability ‚Äì It can scale horizontally by adding more worker nodes, making it suitable for high-load production environments.
     - Periodic Task Scheduling ‚Äì Works well with Celery Beat, allowing us to schedule tasks (like downloading ISINs every 24 hours) in a cron-like fashion.
     - Retries & Error Handling ‚Äì If a task fails (e.g., network issue during ISIN download), Celery can retry it automatically.
     - Monitoring ‚Äì Supports monitoring tools like Flower to track task execution.
     - Is It Reliable and Scalable?
     - Yes, Celery is reliable and scalable when properly configured with Redis/RabbitMQ as a broker 
     - However, at extreme scale, Redis as a broker may cause memory issues if too many tasks are queued.
     - Celery requires worker processes, which means more servers for scaling.
     - Alternatives for Production at Scale
     - If Celery doesn‚Äôt scale well at very high loads:
     - Apache Kafka ‚Äì If tasks involve real-time streaming of events.
     - Kubernetes CronJobs ‚Äì If running in a Kubernetes environment, for high availability.
     - For most Django applications, Celery + Redis is the best balance of simplicity, reliability, and scalability.

2. In what circumstances would you use Flask instead of Django and vice versa? 
  - Ans: 

    - When to Use Flask?
       - Lightweight APIs or Microservices ‚Äì If we just need a REST API with minimal setup.
       - Prototyping & Proof of Concept ‚Äì Quick development without unnecessary complexity.
       - Machine Learning Models ‚Äì Deploying AI models via API.
       - Custom architectures ‚Äì When we want full control over your tech stack.

    - When to Use Django?
       - Rapid Development ‚Äì Built-in authentication, ORM, admin panel save time.
       - Complex & Scalable Apps ‚Äì Like e-commerce platforms, dashboards, CMS.
       - Security-Critical Applications ‚Äì Django provides security features like CSRF protection, SQL injection prevention by default.
       - Database-heavy applications ‚Äì Django ORM simplifies complex database interactions.
